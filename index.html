                    <p>As a key contributor to a collaborative initiative, I played a pivotal role in developing a dynamic and user-friendly website aimed at promoting diversity and inclusivity in the tech industry. Leveraging Django Rest Framework for the backend and React.js for the frontend, our project facilitated the creation of profiles for women and non-binary individuals in the technology field. By providing a platform for the community to share these profiles, we empowered young people to see themselves reflected in the tech world, thereby breaking down barriers and inspiring future tech enthusiasts.</p>

                        Summer Escapes Project
                    </h2>
                    <p>Summer Escapes stands as my maiden project during my studies at TAFE Queensland. This responsive website was crafted for 'Summer Escapes,' a budding startup that focuses on providing insights into local summer holiday destinations. The task revolved around addressing mobile device compatibility issues, culminating in the creation of four webpages: Home, Reviews, Feedback (complete with a user-friendly form), and Contact. All these pages feature a shared external CSS style sheet, ensuring a uniform look and feel. The website dynamically adapts to various screen sizes, allocating 80% of the screen for desktop, 100% for tablets, and fully optimizing phone layouts. Summer Escapes sets the stage for a comprehensive and intuitive travel experience, no matter the device.</p>

Using PHP and MySQL, I created a responsive and secure online store that exceeded the client's expectations. The website showcased a modern design and enhanced functionality, allowing customers to browse and filter mobile phones by brand, price, and stock availability. Admin users had secure access to manage products, users, and track changes with a comprehensive change log. </p>
